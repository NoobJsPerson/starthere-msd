Welcome to the Mobile Speedrunning Discord (MSD)! <:MSD:446295242929471488> \nWe are a warm and friendly speedrunning community that mainly focuses on playing on mobile devices. We are talkative, laid-back, and very community-focused. A server with so many people needs rules to work, though, and so we expect you'll follow them to the best of your abilities. Failure to abide by the rules can result in a mute, kick, or ban.\n:no_entry_sign: Hate speech.\n:no_entry_sign: Shitposting.\n:no_entry_sign: Spamming.\n:no_entry_sign: Political discussion, if anyone asks to stop.\n:no_entry_sign: Memes, unless speedrunning related.\n:no_entry_sign: Swearing occasionally is fine, but don't overdo it.\n:no_entry_sign: Promoting self-harm.\n:no_entry_sign: Discord invites, unless speedrunning related.\n:no_entry_sign: NSFW.\n:no_entry_sign: Phishing.\n:warning: English is the main language of the MSD, please stick to speaking English in chat.",
